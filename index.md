I'm a PhD student in Seismology working on how seamounts influence 1) the earthquake cycle with Prof. Camilla Cattania ([Fault Mechanics @MIT]), and 2) the ocean overturning with Prof. [Raffaele Ferrari]. My research interests are in numerical methods, machine learning, physical oceanography, and geophysics.
